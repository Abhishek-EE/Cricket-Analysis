# Cricket Data Analyzer

This project aims to develop a Python application that collects, analyzes, and visualizes cricket data in real-time.

## Features

* Collects data from reliable sources (e.g., Cricinfo, Cricbuzz APIs, ESPNcricinfo) using API calls and web scraping.
* Handles real-time updates using WebSockets or API polling.
* Stores data in a structured format (e.g., SQLite database, CSV files).
* Performs various analyses on the data (e.g., batting averages, win probabilities, trends).
* Creates visualizations (graphs, charts, dashboards) using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
* Provides a user interface (optional) for interacting with the data and visualizations.

## Project Structure

* `data_collection/`: Scripts for collecting data from various sources.
* `data_analysis/`:  Modules for data processing and analysis.
* `data_visualization/`:  Code for generating visualizations.
* `utils/`: Utility functions for data cleaning, error handling, etc.
* `main.py`: Main application script.
